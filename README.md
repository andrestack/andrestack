# my basics


- 👋 Hi, I’m André and this is my GitHub @andrestack
  
- 👀 I’m having a hard time transitioning into tech and learning how to code, but I AM LOVING EVERY MINUTE OF IT! I am into function based programming and wrote my first line of HTML ca. 1 year ago.
  
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning and relearning all the basics I covered during my bootcamp and am currently working on:
  - Sala: a one-stop shop for online teachers and tutors to teach their classes and automatically generate invoices; currently pondering to switch the web conferencing API
  - dAItabes: putting all my saved links and IG reels on all the cool AI stuff in one UI... YES! Another one of those aggregators!
  - Hinterland Web: a web agency website built with Astro
  - Personal Website with Astro
  - Open-source: Hyperstaker - super charging early stage Web3 software projects
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on React / NextJS projects that integrate both ends of the wonderful world of requests and responses!
