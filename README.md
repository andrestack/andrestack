- 👋 Hi, I’m André and this is my stack @andrestack
  
- 👀 I’m interested in function based programming and also where this journey is going to take me. Since I have basically only writte my first line of HTML 4 months ago.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning all the basics I covered during my bootcamp and continuing to work on my project Sala, which a one-stop shop for online teachers and tutors to teach their classes and automatically generate invoices from that.
  My next goal is TypeScript and AWS for the backend.
